# k8simon
The main code for k8simon.com site - a developers experience with Kubernetes.

## Constituents
Now made with 

* an html 5 theme from https://www.styleshout.com/ and with 
* http://gridsome.org 
* Azure static web apps
* github actions for CI/CD

...this site is superfast and utilises someone else's great html design (better than my own)!

Originally I tried using Blazor web assembly - which I got working, but with 13 seconds load time (time to download WASM and then process the javascript) - it was just too slow for what I soon realised was really a static website. Still, nice to experiment.
